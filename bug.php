This code suffers from a subtle error related to how PHP handles type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.

```php
<?php
$a = '10';
$b = 10;

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal";
} else {
  echo "Not equal";
}
?>
```

While many expect the output to be "Not equal" (because one value is a string and the other an integer), PHP's loose comparison (`==`) will actually consider them equal.  This is because PHP performs type juggling before comparison, converting the string '10' to an integer 10 for the comparison.

This can lead to unexpected results in applications where strict type comparisons are crucial, especially when dealing with user inputs.
